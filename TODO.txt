- Scrape icons/styling for statuses:

  - icons from https://keystone.shotgunstudio.com/images/sg_icon_image_map.png
  - style from https://keystone.shotgunstudio.com/stylesheets/base_38666.css
  - `curl https://keystone.shotgunstudio.com/user/login` reveals the
    build number (38725), but I don't know if that is helpful.

  - json from any page source
  - create .sg-status with background info and .sg-icon/.sg-icon-{type} with icon
